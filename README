Program Description:
  The program does a mock March Mammal Madness 
  bracket to find the winner based off of health, 
  aggression (percent as decimal), and attack 
  (integer of damage done with one hit).
  
  Each animal is stored in the "animals.txt" file as:
 
  {
    name: String
    attack: Integer
    health: Integer
    aggression: Double
  }

  The file is parsed one line at a time; that means that the contents of the curly
  braces may be swapped around in any order. More items may be added as long
  as they are fully implemented in the Animal class and FileParser.GetAnimals() method.

  In order to operate the program you will need to read
  the animals from the file into an ArrayList<Animal>. This is 
  accomplished using the FileParser class and FileParser.GetAnimals() method.

  Each one of the blocks in the text file is stored in an 
  Animal class which has a name, attack damage, health, and aggression.

  The Arena class handles the fighting. It goes about this
  by adding in randomness based off a chance (the animal's aggression) to 
  determine if the animal should attack. It does a fixed iteration count to determine 
  who the winner is in the most situations. Then it adds it to a winners list which will be sorted
  at the end of the function to find the animal that wins the most. Then it halves the winners list,
  and repeats the function again until there is one animal left.
  It then returns the last animal standing.
